# Under Development

## Folder Structure

Directories are grouped by components, eg:

    sa/
        Standard agent deployment files (ps1, json files, etc) specific to Standard Agents.
    ga/
        Graphic agent deployment files

    resources/
        Common resources (ps1 scripts, json files) that can be used by other components

Reusable components specific to Standard Agents should remain under the sa/ folder.
